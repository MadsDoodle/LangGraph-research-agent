\section{Introduction}
Video language models are at the forefront of multimodal AI, integrating visual and textual data to understand and generate content. Recent advancements in models like HoloCine \cite{holo\_cine2025} have demonstrated the potential for creating coherent multi-shot narratives from text prompts. This paper reviews the latest research and technologies in video language modeling.
\section{Related Work}
Numerous models have been developed to tackle the challenges of video language understanding. For instance, HoloCine \cite{holo\_cine2025} introduces a holistic framework for generating multi-shot video narratives, addressing the narrative gap in text-to-video models.
\section{Methodology}
The methodologies employed in video language models typically involve complex architectures like transformers, which use attention mechanisms to process and integrate multimodal data.
\subsection{HoloCine Model}
HoloCine employs a Window Cross-Attention mechanism and Sparse Inter-Shot Self-Attention to manage narrative coherence across shots. This approach marks a significant advancement in the field.
\section{Applications}
Video language models have a wide range of applications, including video captioning, summarization, and question answering. These applications benefit from the models' ability to understand and generate language in response to video content.
